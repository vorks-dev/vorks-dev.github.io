It avoids unnecessary abstractions and instead emphasizes clarity, performance, and visual balance.\n\nLysa automatically extracts file and EXIF metadata to help organize photo libraries without requiring manual input. Folders become albums, metadata becomes structure, and navigation stays fluid even in large collections.\n\nKey capabilities include:\n\n- Gallery-style browsing of local photo directories\n- Automatic extraction of file and EXIF metadata\n- Flexible sorting based on technical and temporal attributes\n- Full-resolution viewing with zoom, pan, and detailed inspection\n\nBuilt with C++ and Qt/QML, Lysa is a fully native application with a modern interface and minimal footprint. No cloud sync, no tracking, no hidden data flow - your photos remain exactly where they belong.\n\nLysa is open-source and available via **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vorks-dev/lysa/releases/latest)**."

While the appearance has evolved, the underlying principles remain unchanged.\n\nAt vorks., products are designed to *just vork*. They aim to stay out of the way, avoid unnecessary complexity, and feel dependable in everyday use. Decisions are made with empathy for the end user, prioritizing clarity over features and usefulness over noise.\n\nPrivacy and data integrity are treated as fundamental requirements. Wherever possible, applications are designed to run fully on-device, ensuring users remain in control of their data at all times.\n\nTransparency is equally important. Open-source development allows anyone to inspect how things work under the hood and builds trust through verifiability rather than promises.\n\nThis new branding is not a change in direction, but a clearer expression of intent. vorks. continues to focus on thoughtful, accessible software that works quietly, reliably, and with respect for the people who use it."

This work resulted in the creation of **[datamanager.js](https://datamanager.js.org)**, now available as a standalone module.\n\nAll improvements are bundled into this release.
